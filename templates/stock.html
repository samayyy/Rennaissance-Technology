			<h3>What are stocks?</h3>
			<p>A stock (also known as equity) is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation. This entitles the owner of the stock to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits equal to how much stock they own. Units of stock are called "shares."</p>
			<br>
			<p>Stocks are bought and sold predominantly on stock exchanges, though there can be private sales as well, and are the foundation of many individual investors' portfolios. These transactions have to conform to government regulations which are meant to protect investors from fraudulent practices. Historically, they have outperformed most other investments over the long run.1ï»¿ These investments can be purchased from most online stock brokers. Stock investment differs greatly from real estate investment </p>
			<br>
			<p>Corporations issue sell stock to raise funds to operate their businesses. The holder of stock (a shareholder) has now bought a piece of the corporation and, depending on the type of shares held, may have a claim to a part of its assets and earnings. In other words, a shareholder is now an owner of the issuing company. Ownership is determined by the number of shares a person owns relative to the number of outstanding shares. For example, if a company has 1,000 shares of stock outstanding and one person owns 100 shares, that person would own and have claim to 10% of the company's assets and earnings.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Stock holders do not own corporations; they own shares issued by corporations. But corporations are a special type of organization because the law treats them as legal persons.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Open a demat account:</b>: Opening a demat account is a simple process. You will need your Pan card, savings bank account, Aadhaar card and a personalied cheque. You can either apply online through NSDL, CDSL or ask your broker to do it for you. A demat account is needed to hold shares in a dematerialised or non-physical form.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Find a broker: </b>: You need a broker to buy and sell shares in the stock market. A broker is an individual or an entity registered with Sebi, the stock market regulator. Choose a broker after comparing the brokerage plans and services offered by different brokers. Go for a brokerage plan as per your investment needs.</p>
